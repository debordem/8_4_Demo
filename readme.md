*There are files outside this folder you should leave alone if you want password protection.*

Your home page ***must*** be called **index.html**.


## Password protection

This site structure is password protected, as some sites may contain images of students.

If your site **does not** contain images of students, or sensitive information (names etc) then you can remove the password files and just create a site in the folder.
